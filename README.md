# Bengali-Number-Plate-Recognition-System


This MATLAB-based number plate recognition system detects and recognizes characters from a vehicle's number plate. The system processes images of vehicles, detects the number plate region, segments the characters, recognizes the individual characters, and performs text-to-speech conversion of the recognized number plate.

## Overview

The number plate recognition system consists of four primary functions:

1. `process_images`: Preprocesses the input image and calls other functions for further processing.
2. `get_max_area_bounding_box`: Detects the bounding box for the largest area in the image (assumed to be the number plate).
3. `process_and_segment_number_plate`: Further processes the number plate, segments the characters, and recognizes them.
4. `text_to_speech`: Converts the recognized characters to speech.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
3. Run the script and Load the desired image file into the `main.m`.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB

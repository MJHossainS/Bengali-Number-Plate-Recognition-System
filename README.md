# Bengali-Number-Plate-Recognition-System


This MATLAB-based number plate recognition system detects and recognizes characters from a vehicle's number plate. The system processes images of vehicles, detects the number plate region, segments the characters, recognizes the individual characters, and performs text-to-speech conversion of the recognized number plate.

## Overview

The number plate recognition system consists of four primary functions:

1. `process_images`: Preprocesses the input image and calls other functions for further processing.
2. `get_max_area_bounding_box`: Detects the bounding box for the largest area in the image (assumed to be the number plate).
3. `process_and_segment_number_plate`: Further processes the number plate, segments the characters, and recognizes them.
4. `text_to_speech`: Converts the recognized characters to speech.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
3. Load the desired image file into the `process_images` function and run the script.

## Dependencies

- MATLAB
